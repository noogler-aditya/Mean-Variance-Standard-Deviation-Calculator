## 📝Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project implements a Python function to calculate key statistical metrics for a 3x3 matrix. The function takes a list of numbers, reshapes it into a matrix, and computes metrics such as mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.
 

## 🌟 Features

- ✍️ **- Converts a list of exactly 9 numbers into a 3x3 NumPy array.
- 🗑️ **Computes the following metrics:
- 📈 **Mean**
- 📥 **Variance**:
- 📥 **Standard Deviation**:
- 📥 **Maximum**:
- 📥 **Minimum**:

- Outputs the metrics in a structured dictionary format.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ⚛️ **Python 3.x**
- 🎨 **NumPy library**

## 📦 Installation
